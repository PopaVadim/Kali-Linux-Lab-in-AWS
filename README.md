<h1>Kali Linux Lab in AWS</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a walkthrough of how to create a Kali Linux lab in the Cloud using an AWS Free Tier Account. These services allow us to get some exposure and hands-on experience with AWS Cloud Services free of charge for a period of 1 year. We have the option to receive more services than the Free Tier offers for the standard Amazon rates. To avoid any unwanted charges we will set up Amazon Alerts if we are getting close to consuming our Free Tier limits.

<h2>Environments and Utilities Used</h2>

- <b>AWS</b>
- <b>Kali Linux</b>
- <b>MacOS</b> 
- <b>Xfce Desktop Envoirment<b/>
- <b>TightVNC<b/>
- <b>Terminal</b>
